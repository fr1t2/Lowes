# Lowes
Lowes price scraper
by Friday

This will let you get the price of an item at all Lowe's stores, even if the item is no longer listed on lowe's website.  Currently it only gets the price, but all the info is in JSTEXT.  The script can be easily updated to get the quantity, if the item is in stock, etc by extracting from JSTEXT.

Requirements:

Python 3.x (I use 3.6.3)
required modules such as beautifulsoup

Required files:

lowesNationwide.py - edit and replace 999919858 with the lowes item SKU (it's in the URL)
storesall.txt - this is a list of stores to search.  By default it has all lowes stores.  If you only want to search some stores put the store numbers in this file
allstores.csv - do not edit this file.  It is used for merging
